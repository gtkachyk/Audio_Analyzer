Audio analyzer is an audio mixing tool that allows artists and engineers to A-B compare tracks with a single click.
The need for this application stems from the following: 
First, many DAWs lack dedicated features for A-B comparisons, making them cumbersome to perform and disruptive to the work flow.
Second, music is produced on a wide variety of DAWs with limited compatibility. This makes it challenging to use different
workstations and collaborate with others. A stand-alone program solves this issue by eliminating DAW-specific restrictions.

Program behaviours and limitations:
    - MP3, AIFF with uncompressed PCM, WAV with uncompressed PCM, and MPEG-4 with AAC are only supported file types.
